# COVID-19-County-Report-Generator
This project is a Python-based tool designed to generate detailed COVID-19 reports for any county in the United States using data from [Johns Hopkins University's GitHub repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). The program utilizes `pandas` and `geopandas` libraries to process and analyze real-world COVID-19 data.
